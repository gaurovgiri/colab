# Git POEM

In the realm of code, where branches sway,
Resides a tool, both mighty and gray.
Its name is Git, a version control guide,
To track changes and time's turbulent tide.

Commit by commit, it weaves a tale,
Recording revisions, like whispers on a gale.
Branches diverfe, and conflicts arise,
Yet Git remains, with steadfast guise.
